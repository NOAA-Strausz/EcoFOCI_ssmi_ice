for making movie from many files:
easiest method:

ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' test.mp4
-This uses the glob function of the bash shell.  It appears that the codec is 
chosen properly with the file extension.  Framerate is quite high though.  Use
the -r option in front of the input to set the framerate of the images. For example:
    ffmpeg -r 1 -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' test.mp4
this will set the frame rate at 1 picture frame per second.  So this would usually
mean one day per second which is quite slow.  A frame rate of 8 per second has
good results.  Putting a -r option on the output file will set the framerate to something more normal.
This might be good for some players.  For example:
    ffmpeg -r 8 -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -r 30 test2.mp4
It turns out that players such as quicktime and windows default player don't like videos made
with this method.  Another switch is needed, -pix_fmt.  Use yuv420p as that seems to work.
    ffmpeg -r 8 -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p test2.mp4



Many more options can be set.  Check ffmpeg manual or many websites
